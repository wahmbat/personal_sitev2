During this internship, I, alongside Dr. Javiera Rudolph, am working on the creation of an open-educational teaching resource on the fundamentals of SIR models. SIR models are a type of differential equation model used by epidemiologists to simulate how populations move between different "compartments" indicating their disease status (suceptible, infectious, and recovered).

The image is an example of the curves produced by the SIR model, indicating the number of people in a population who are susceptible to a disease, infectious with the disease, and recovered from the disease at a given time.

Our instructional approach emphasizes computational literacy—the ability to apply computational tools and ways of thinking to solve problems, even outside traditional computing contexts. We are building the teaching module using a combination of Quarto and simulation applications made using the R package Shiny to introduce those with a limited background in mathematics and biology to SIR models and, more generally, the field of epidemiology.
