My research at the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity, 
performed as part of UF's Emerging Scholars Program and under the guidance of Dr. Keith
Willmott, focuses on the creation and analysis 
of species distribution maps for Neotropical butterflies in the subtribe Euptychiina.
Part of the challenge of this research is in the incomplete and oftentimes 
erroneous nature of entomological specimen data. To address this, and make it easier
for future researchers seeking to create distribution maps, I am working to develop transparent 
and reproducible workflows in R and QGIS for cleaning, validating, and
mapping locality data.

Following the creation of these distribution maps, Dr. Willmott and I plan to conduct statistical analysis
on the emerging patterns in Euptychian species diversity across the Neotropics, specifically in 
relation to the ecological hypothesis of the mid-domain effect (MDE). The MDE is a proposed null
model in macroecology which suggests that species richness will peak in the center of a bounded 
geographical region due to the natural random overlap of species ranges. We plan to investigate this 
phenomenon by analyzing the degree to which geographic factors, namely the distance from the nearest continental 
boundary, predicts Euptychian species richness while controlling for other biological and environmental variables.
