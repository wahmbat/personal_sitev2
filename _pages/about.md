Hi! My name is Anjali Tomerlin and I'm a first year Statistics and Mathematics B.S. student at the University of Florida. 

I'm really passionate about both the mathematical theory of statistics as well as how to apply statistical methods to research in quantative and disease ecology. Some relevant classes I've taken so far includes:

- MAS4105: Linear Algebra
- MHF3202: Sets and Logic
- MAC2313: Calculus 3
- STA4321: Probability Theory
- ENY2040: Introduction to Entomology

Outside of my coursework, I am an undergraduate research assistant at the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity, an intern at the UF Health Science Center Libraries, a workshop coordinator for UF Data Science & Informatics---UF's largest data science organization---and the math sub-organization director for oSTEM, a club for queer students in STEM! 

In my free time, I love baking, painting pottery, taking photos of the beautiful woods and lakes surrounding the UF campus, and playing video games (my favorite game is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night)!
