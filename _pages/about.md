Hi! My name is Anjali Tomerlin and I'm a first year Statistics and Mathematics B.S. student at the University of Florida. 

I'm really passionate about both the mathematical theory of statistics as well as how to apply statistical methods to research in quantative and disease ecology. Outside of my coursework, I am an undergraduate research assistant at the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity as well as an intern at the UF Health Science Center Library. 

In my free time, I love baking, taking photos of the beautiful woods and lakes surrounding the UF campus, and playing video games (my favorite game is Castlevania: Symphony of the Night)!
